## Phase 1

### What works ?
- [x] `docker-compose` spins up all the services.
- [x] The services have been tested manually using `localhost:<port>/docs`
- [x] Celery and Redis work as expected.
- [x] Add a frontend (Streamlit preferably)

### ToDo:
- [ ] Replace the similarity with actual deep learning model.
- [ ] Make a cookiecutter template for the project.
