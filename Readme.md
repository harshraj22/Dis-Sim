## Intro:
Dis-Sim is a Microservices architecture based distributed image similarity measuring system. It uses asynchronous message queue to communicate across microservices. Its distributed architecture makes it highly scalable and fault tolerant.
It has a built in data monitoring and analytics service which uses Kafka as a message broker, and sqlite3 as a database. It also has a subscription based rate limiter that limits the request based on the subscription tier the user belongs

### Demo:
![streamlit-frontend-2022-06-08-16-06-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46635452/210269580-5c7ea254-e427-4dc8-bf39-f80cafd65cc2.gif)




### Getting started:
1. Run `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up ` to pull and start all the containers. <details> <summary> Build from source: </summary> `docker-compose up --build ` to build from the source, and not use the already built image from dockerhub. </details>
2. Open the browser and navigate to `localhost:8501`. Note that `8501` is the port specified in the dockerfile of the `frontend` service (`src/frontend/Dockerfile`).
3. Use the existing credentials `username: test, password: test`. Would be soon adding frontend to register new user.


<strong>Note:</strong> Since there are multiple services spinning up, it would take a little longer for all the services to start up before you can start playing with the similarity service. The images are large, and a good internet connection is required. You can expect the whole service to spin up within 5 minutes.


### Using custom similarity measurer:
Adding a custom similarity measurer is as simple as overwriding the `similarity` function in the `src/similarity/models` module.
```python
# import your new similarity measurer

from my_similarity_measurer import MySimilarityMeasurer
```

```python
# add your new similarity measurer in similarity method

@app.task
def similarity(img1, img2) -> float:
    ...

    score = MySimilarityMeasurer().similarity(img1, img2)
    return score
```

Make sure to add the dependencies of your new similarity measurer in `src/similarity/requirements.txt`
